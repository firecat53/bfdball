* Website for Bellingham Firefighter's Community Ball
    * Setup to use [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
    * Content pages are in content/
    * Images and CSS are in static/
    * public/ is in .gitignore. That's where the actual site is generated by
      Hugo.
    * The themes are submodules
    * Hugo uses an absolute url for the background image, so it may not show up
      while testing unless the site URL in config.toml is actually being used.
* When creating the Paypal button, make sure to select advanced options so the
  quantity can be changed and the buyer is redirected to complete.html after the
  sale.
* To build nginx container containing the site:

        docker build -t bfdball .
